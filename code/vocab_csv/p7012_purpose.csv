Which purpose is connected to 'first party tracking' from our original hypothesis?,,I'm wondering if swe should combine the first party tracking and profile build into a merged agreement 3 as both of those purposes are really about 'purpose = marketing'?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which purpose is connected to 'profile build within entity' from our original hypothesis?,,I also think we need to give some thought to 'Purpose = Customer Service' (customer care in DPV at present?). It is largely impossible to have 'service delivery' on its own without having some means to fix problems if/ when they emerge (the role of customer service).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which purpose is connected to 'anonymous aggregrated sharing' from our original hypothesis?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
