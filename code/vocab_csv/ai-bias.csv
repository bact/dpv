AI specific Biases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AIBias,AI Bias,"Bias associated with development, use, or other activities involving an AI technology or system",risk:Bias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,,2024-09-18,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AutomationBias,Automation Bias,"Bias tha occurs due to propensity for humans to favour suggestions from automated decision-making systems and to ignore contradictory information made without automation, even if it is correct",risk:CognitiveBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DataBias,Data Bias,Bias that occurs due to unaddressed data properties that lead to AI systems that perform better or worse for different groups,ai:AIBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DataLabelsAndLabellingProcessBias,Data Labels And Labelling Process Bias,Bias that occurs due to the labelling process itself introducing societal or cognitive biases,ai:DataBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NonRepresentativeSamplingBias,Non-Representative Sampling Bias,"Bias that occurs if a dataset is not representative of the intended deployment environment, where the model learns biases based on the ways in which the data is non-representative",ai:DataBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MissingFeaturesAndLabelsBias,Missing Features And Labels Bias,Bias that occurs when features are missing from individual training samples,ai:DataBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,If the frequency of missing features is higher for one group than another then this presents another vector for bias,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DataAggregationBias,Data Aggregation Bias,Bias that occurs from aggregating data covering different groups of objects that might have different statistical distributions which introduce bias into the data used to train AI systems,ai:DataBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DistributedTrainingBias,Distributed Training Bias,Bias that occurs due to distributed machine having different sources of data that do not have the same distribution of feature space,ai:DataBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EngineeringDecisionBias,Engineering Decision Bias,"Bias that occurs due to machine learning model architectures - encompassing all model specifications, parameters and manually designed features",ai:AIBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,Data bias and human cognitive bias can contribute to such bias,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FeatureEngineeringBias,Feature Engineering Bias,"Bias that occurs from steps such as encoding, data type conversion, dimensionality reduction and feature selection which are subject to choices made by the AI developer and introduce bias in the ML model",ai:EngineeringDecisionBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AlgorithmSelectionBias,Algorithm Selection Bias,Bias that occurs from the selection of machine learning algorithms built into the AI system which introduce unwanted bias in predictions made by the system because the type of algorithm used introduces a variation in the performance of the ML model,ai:EngineeringDecisionBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HyperparameterTuningBias,Hyperparameter Tuning Bias,"Bias that occurs from hyperparameters defining how the model is structured and which cannot be directly trained from the data like model parameters, where hyperparameters affect the model functioning and accuracy of the model",ai:EngineeringDecisionBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
InformativenessBias,Informativeness Bias,"Bias that occurs or some groups, the mapping between inputs present in the data and outputs are more difficult to learn and where a model that only has one feature set available, can be biased against the group whose relationships are difficult to learn from available data",ai:EngineeringDecisionBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,"This can happen when some features are highly informative about one group, while a different set of features is highly informative about another group. If this is the case, then a model that only has one feature set available, can be biased against the group whose relationships are difficult to learn from available data",ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ModelBias,Model Bias,"Bias that occurs when ML uses functions like a maximum likelihood estimator to determine parameters, and there is data skew or under-representation present in the data, where the maximum likelihood estimation tends to amplify any underlying bias in the distribution",ai:EngineeringDecisionBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ModelInteractionBias,Model Interaction Bias,Bias that occurs from the structure of a model to create biased predictions,ai:EngineeringDecisionBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ModelExpressivenessBias,Model Expressiveness Bias,Bias that occurs from the number and nature of parameters in a model as well as the neural network topology which affect the expressiveness of the model and any feature that affects model expressiveness differently across groups,ai:ModelInteractionBias,risk:RiskConcept,,,,,ISO/IEC 24027:2021,2024-09-13,,accepted,Daniel Doherty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
