E0001,Implications of using SKOS vs OWL,"<p>This example highlights the implications of using DPV with RDFS+SKOS and OWL semantics. The RDFS+SKOS model is suitable for when DPV concepts have to be used 'directly' e.g. an use-case wants to use 'Encryption' from DPV as a technical measure without creating a specific 'instance' representing their implementation of the encryption. RDFS+SKOS model is also suitable for when an use-case wants to further create an hierarchical taxonomy of the different 'Encryption' concepts they are using. Such use of DPV concepts covers both T-box and A-box, and does not restrict or require the underlying ontology/schema to be constantly changed as new concepts are identified in an use-case.</p>
      <p>In comparison, the OWL2 model defines concepts as classes and instances with a clear separation between the two i.e. the Tbox and Abox are separate. This means the concept 'Encryption' cannot be directly used with OWL2 semantics and an instance of it must first be created. If instead DPV had provided 'Encryption' as an instance (of Technical Measure) then the further expansion and creation of a hierarchy of encryption concepts described earlier is not feasible in OWL2 as it results in a complex graph which is not efficient for reasoning. Further, making changes such as promoting 'Encryption' from instance to class requires changing the ontology/schema - which may not always be possible or feasible in use-cases.</p>
      <p>Thus, the relative strengths and weaknesses of RDFS+SKOS and OWL2 serialisations dictate which should be used. RDFS+SKOS is 'lightweight' and better if the use-case only requires rudimentary or simple reasoning. OWL2 is  better suited for semantic reasoners that can perform complex discovery and validation processes but require more strict and restricted use of concepts. By providing both serialisations, DPV enables the adopters to choose the most suitable serialisation that supports their use-case and/or existing implementations, and retains semantic interoperability based on converting between SKOS and OWL2 (see <a href=""https://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/SKOS/skos-and-owl/master.html"">Using OWL and SKOS (2008)</a>).</p>",E0001.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0002,Extending concepts to represent use-case specific information,"<p>DPV defines the (broad) concept of <a href=""https://w3id.org/dpv#Marketing""><code>Marketing</code></a> in its <code>Purpose</code> hierarchy to represent information about (purposes related to) marketing activities and topics. For a use-case which requires representing purposes (note: plural) related to <i>marketing of new products</i>, the broad <code>Marketing</code> concept is extended as a <i>child</i> or <i>subclass</i> concept for representing the intended purpose as, e.g. <code>MarketingNewProducts</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Here the prefix <code>ex:</code> represents <code>http://example.com#</code> - which is a convention for representing additional examples or concepts, such as those created as part of the use-case.

E0003,Extending multiple concepts,"<p>For example, two TV companies (<code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code>) extend the concept <code>Optimisation</code> to reflect their respective purposes. When exchanging information about their use-cases with each other (or with a third party), by following the chain of use-case specific concepts it is possible to deduce that both <code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code> are doing optimisations for consumers. Thus a common language or interface can be developed based on using DPV as a point of interoperability and commonality which can be used by adopters to define the specifics of their use-case. For example, in the above use-case, a common notice generation algorithm could be created and used to inform users of both services the purposes each company is using data for.</p>",E0003.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Purpose,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0006,Nesting Processes,"<p>Consider the example where <em>Acme</em>, as a <em>DataController</em>, maintains records of its processing activities using <code>Process</code> to represent one of its services. In this, it collects email, uses it for internal analyses based on <em>Legitimate Interests</em>, and also sends marketing information by using a processor based on the data subject's consent.

In addition to this, the person's identifier associated with that dataset to enable monitoring future appointments is considered sensitive within the medical centre. Note that the examples use the [[PD]] extension to represent some concepts.</p>
        <p>In this example, the knowledge that blood samples are of type 'special category' can be inferred from the fact that they are a form of <i>Medical Health</i> which is a 'special category'.

E0012,Indicating Data Sources,"<p>Data sources can be the data subject (direct or indirect), the data controller or processor (itself), or another entity (third party). The below example provides an overview of these with distinctions between source and method of generation.</p>
        <p>In this example, <code>ex:S01</code> represents direct collection of data from the data subject, while <code>ex:S02</code> represents indirect collection where data is derived or observed - or undergoes any operation that still points to the data subject as the source. <code>ex:S03</code> infers data, which means the inferring entity (the Controller in this case) is the source of this data - even if the inferred data is based on data collected from the Data Subject. <code>ex:S04</code> has data sourced from another entity - such as a Third Party, but could also refer to a Data Processor. <code>ex:S05</code> represents collection of data from a public dataset that has been published by the data subject themselves.</p>
        <p>Note that the above example is illustrative - it may be pertinent to provide documentation about each data source to ensure sufficient information is recorded for intended purposes. For example, the method of collection (e.g. forms), or inference (e.g. algorithm), or public dataset (e.g. link, license).</p>",E0012.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:DataSource,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0013,Spam filter as Automated Decision Making with Human Involvement,"<p>Consider the use of a spam filter that is based on automated processing operations where humans provide inputs, have oversight of the operation, and results in automated decision making for whether communications should be propagated. A new separate filter is developed that utilises a novel spam detection criteria that also takes into account communications other than emails for the sender and makes automated decisions whether to permit communication to proceed. Such explicit annotation of several high-risk operations assists in performing impact assessments for this technology, as well as understanding the extent and effectiveness of human involvement to mitigate risks and issues.</p>
        <p>In this example, the Spam Filter process allows the users to reverse the effects (i.e. emails marked as spam) but does not allow opting out from the process (i.e. stop spam filtering). The spam detection algorithm performs automated decision making (by deciding which emails to accept), systemic monitoring (of communications), and evaluation and scoring (by scoring contents of emails and senders/recipients). The spam detection algorithm also indicates what human involvement is expected - to provide input (e.g. mark emails as spam) and intervention (e.g. change spam criterias).</p>",E0013.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:AutomationLevel,dpv:HumanInvolvement",,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0014,Denoting Legal Basis within a Process,"<p>The <code>LegalBasis</code> can be associated with any concept using the relation <code>hasLegalBasis</code>. Such associations are of three types: (1) where the legal basis refers to an instance, such as the consent or contract associated with a particular data subject; (2)  where the legal basis refers to the category that will be used to justify processing, such as the concept <i>consent</i> to denote consent will be the basis for indicated processing; and lastly (3) where the legal basis is defined with a context, such as <i>consent of service consumers</i>.</p>",E0014.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:LegalBasis,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0016,Indicating details about an individual's consent,"<p>In this example, an individual's consent is recorded with abstraction in the form of linking to a common process instance from the previous example.

E0073,Tracking the status of a Notice across its lifecycle,"In this example, statuses associated with a notice are maintained in a record. The first part shows a notice status within a common process representing all users showing the notice has been communicated i.e. shown or delivered to the users. The second method shows a data processing record where the notice status is included as part of other matters e.g. data collection or rights exercise. The third method shows a record containing only the notice status for a specific user. The fourth method shows how the notice status can also be recorded as part of the notice metadata itself.",E0073.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:NoticeStatus,dpv:hasNoticeStatus",,accepted,2024-12-17,Harshvardhan J.

E0074,Expressing involvement of a 'human subject' in a process,"This example shows how the involvement of humans can be expressed in various contexts. The first part shows how a specific individual can be asserted to be involved as a 'human subject' in some process. The second part shows how a process or service can assert the involvement of specific categories of humans as subjects. The third part shows how humans can be expressed to be involved in a specific role (as participants) and are declared to be vulnerable. The fourth part clarifies the distinction between stating involvement of users as humans for oversight, and as data subjects in relation to their personal data.",E0074.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:HumanSubject,dpv:hasHumanSubject,dpv:DataSubject,dpv:hasDataSubject,dpv:hasHumanInvolvement,dpv:HumanInvolvement",,accepted,2024-12-17,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0075,Expressing involvement of tracking and profiling in processing,"<p>This example shows how the involvement of tracking and profiling can be expressed within a process. The first method simply states that tracking and profiling occur - this should be considered as bad practice as it does not clarify what the tracking and profiling involves in terms of data and entities - in particular what is being inferred as part of the profiling of data subjects. The second method is a verbose representation showing tracking is a composite process consisting of collecting and using location to generate a 'location tracking data' for the individual, which is then used in the profiling process to infer financial status of the individual.</p>
<p>Through the explicit details of data involved in tracking and profiling, the transparency and accountability principles are easier to satisfy, and we can additionally perform appropriate risk/impact assessments to analyse whether the tracking and profiling should be allowed or not. The verbosity also shows that tracking and profiling are two separate processes - which is essential when the same tracking or profiling occurs in more than one process.  The last part shows how this verbosity can be reduced by taking the tracking and profiling (which as mentioned earlier are likely to be common to several processes) and assigning them a unique IRI or identifier, and using to indicate their involvement in a process.</p>",E0075.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:Tracking,dpv:Profiling",,accepted,2024-12-17,Harshvardhan J.

E0076,Representing contract metadata and controls,"The below example shows using [[DCT]] and DPV properties to represent metadata about contracts. [[DCT]] is used for generic properties such as titles and descriptions, as well as contract-specific properties such as when it was accepted by all parties and the provenance of the contract document. The DPV properties are useful to express properties such as entities involved in specific roles such as Service Provider or a Data Controller, and to denote the type of contract which is useful for its interpretation - such as whether it is a negotiated or a standard form (non-negotiated) contract.",E0076.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Contract,,accepted,2024-12-17,Harshvardhan J.

E0079,Stating status of Legal Obligations,"This example shows how the status of using legal obligations can be represented in terms of it being carried out and it being completed. Note that though the legal obligation has been stated as 'completed', this is not an assessment of whether the requirements of the legal obligation have been completed and are verified, but instead the status represents the use of legal obligation as a legal basis within the process is completed.",E0079.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:LegalObligation,dpv:LegalObligationStatus",,accepted,2024-12-17,Harshvardhan J.

E0085,Role of dpv:Processing and using it in dpv:Process,"<p>This example shows the myriad ways that processing could be used to describe other non-processing operation information such as personal data and entity involved. To accurately represent the information in a consistent and reusable manner, we recommend using dpv:Process as the way to combine concepts in to a 'unit' and to reuse this in other processes. This means dpv:Processing only specifies information about the processing operation involved, and optionally the technology being used if it is relevant to the context.</p>
<p>In Method 1, the processing instance contains personal data and entity involved - this is not recommended as the instance now contains information not related to the processing operation itself. Method 2 shows a processing instance which is implemented using a specific technology. This is acceptable as it describes the processing operation in terms of involved technology, and can be a way to reuse the processing operation in other processes while someone (e.g. IT department) can change the underlying technology. Method 3 represents the best practice of using dpv:Process to describe all concepts in a modular and granular manner with a separation of concerns. Processes can include other processes - so we can describe processing and technology and data involved as a process and involve it in other processes. This makes the task of finding information easier as we only have to look for composition of processes, instead of investigating each purpose or processing or another concept involved for what data or technology it involves.</p>",E0085.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:Processing,dpv:hasProcessing,dpv:isImplementedUsingTechnology,dpv:isImplementedByEntity",,accepted,2025-01-01,Harshvardhan J.
