Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Documentation,Documentation,"Information describing use, functionality, design, or other technical aspects of the Technology",dpv:Concept,sc,,,,,,2024-05-09,,accepted,"Delaram Golpayegani, Harshvardhan J. Pandit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IntendedUse,Intended Use,Describes the 'intended' use of the technology,dpv:Concept,sc,,,,"Intended use can be used to describe how the developer or provider of technology intends it to be used e.g. use a database to store data, and to describe the plan or 'intent' to use the technology by a user or operator e.g. use a database to store and analyse data. Intended Use can involve any concept e.g. DPV's purpose, processing, tech/org measures, and can be low-level purely technical uses such as store data or high-level goals such as legal compliance. Intended Use only describes the intent or ex-ante intention, and may be different from how the technology is being actually used - which is indicated by using isImplementedUsingTechnology in a process or other relevant context.

OperatingEnvironment,Operating Environment,The environment within which the technology operates,dpv:Concept,sc,,,,"Environment here is a broad term used to refer to the immediate surroundings and parts of it that form the context of where the technology operates, for example a room or in open air where specific machines are set up. This helps describe the expectations and set up of systems and, to specify and compare them against ideal conditions or environments",Model Cards by Mitchell et al. (2019),2025-05-29,,accepted,"Harshvardhan J. Pandit, Delaram Golpayegani, Georg P. Krog, Paul Ryan, Julian Flake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
