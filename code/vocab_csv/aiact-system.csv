AI systems & components concepts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AISystem,AI System,"A machine-based system designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.",ai:AISystem,sc,,,AIA (Art. 3(1)),Note All references to the AI Act referred to the provisional agreement published in Feb 2024,2024-04-10,Delaram Golpayegani,accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GPAISystem,General Purpose AI System,"An AI system which is based on a general-purpose AI model, that has the capability to serve a variety of purposes, both for direct use as well as for integration in other AI systems.",eu-aiact:AISystem,sc,,,AIA(Art.3 (44e)),,2024-04-10,Delaram Golpayegani,accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GPAIModel,General Purpose AI Model,"An AI model, including when trained with a large amount of data using self-supervision at scale, that displays significant generality and is capable to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks regardless of the way the model is placed on the market and that can be integrated into a variety of downstream systems or applications. This does not cover AI models that are used before release on the market for research, development and prototyping activities.",ai:Model,sc,,,AIA(Art. 3(44b)),,2024-04-10,Delaram Golpayegani,accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SafetyComponent,Safety Component,"A component of a product or of a system which fulfils a safety function for that product or system, or the failure or malfunctioning of which endangers the health and safety of persons or property.",tech:Component ,sc,,,AIA (Art. 3(14)),,2024-04-10,Delaram Golpayegani,accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EmotionRecognitionSystem,Emotion Recognition System,An AI system for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data.,,eu-aiact:AISystem,"eu-aiact:EmotionRecognition, pd:Biometric",,AIA(Art. 3(34)),,2024-04-10,Delaram Golpayegani,accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BiometricCategorisationSystem,Biometric Categorisation System,An AI system for the purpose of assigning natural persons to specific categories on the basis of their biometric data unless ancillary to another commercial service and strictly necessary for objective technical reasons.,,eu-aiact:AISystem,pd:Biometric,,AIA(Art. 3(35)),,2024-04-10,Delaram Golpayegani,accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RemoteBiometricIdentificationSystem,Remote Biometric Identification System,"An AI system for the purpose of identifying natural persons, without their active involvement, typically at a distance through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database.",,eu-aiact:AISystem,pd:Biometric,,AIAArt. 3(36)),,2024-04-10,Delaram Golpayegani,accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RealtimeRemoteBiometriIdentificationSystem,Real-time Remote Biometric Identification System,"A remote biometric identification system whereby the capturing of biometric data, the comparison and the identification all occur without a significant delay. This comprises not only instant identification, but also limited short delays in order to avoid circumvention.",eu-aiact:RemoteBiometricIdentificationSystem,eu-aiact:AISystem,pd:Biometric,,AIA(Art. 3(37)),,2024-04-10,Delaram Golpayegani,accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PostRemoteBiometriIdentificationSystem,Post Remote Biometric Identification System,A remote biometric identification system other than a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system.,eu-aiact:RemoteBiometricIdentificationSystem,eu-aiact:AISystem,pd:Biometric,,AIA(Art. 3(38)),,2024-04-10,Delaram Golpayegani,accepted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
