While Risk Management methods indicate risk transfer as occurring between entities, this concept is defined more broadly by including 'context or entity' so as to enable modelling cases where the transfer takes place between processes - which may be managed by the same or different entity. Additionally, typical use of 'Transfer' implies a formal mechanism such as an agreement, which is absent from this concept. If only partial responsibility is transferred, such as for a specific measure, then this can be considered as an instance of sharing the risk - for which risk:ShareControl is provided"@en
