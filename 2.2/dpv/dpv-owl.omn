For this concept, DPVCG defines Tracking in the broadest possible sense and strongly recommends adopters to provide their specific definition or interpretation by either extending this concept, through a usage note, or by contributing the specific term back to DPVCG for inclusion in DPV or an extension. This concept may change in the future based on developments in privacy and legal spaces. In DPV, Tracking is defined as a type of processing operation that may collect and/or may use data - which covers both initial collection and usage as well as subsequent use of existing data to track an individual. The classification of Tracking as a processing operation also implies that it is not sufficient as a Purpose on its own and therefore a suitable purpose from the DPV taxonomy should be used to justify it."@en

For this concept, DPVCG defines Tracking in the broadest possible sense and strongly recommends adopters to provide their specific definition or interpretation by either extending this concept, through a usage note, or by contributing the specific term back to DPVCG for inclusion in DPV or an extension. This concept may change in the future based on developments in privacy and legal spaces. In DPV, Tracking is defined as a type of processing operation that may collect and/or may use data - which covers both initial collection and usage as well as subsequent use of existing data to track an individual. The classification of Tracking as a processing operation also implies that it is not sufficient as a Purpose on its own and therefore a suitable purpose from the DPV taxonomy should be used to justify it."@en
