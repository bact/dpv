<h3 id=t01>Information Audit</h3>
<p id=x015 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/202">Issue 202</a></strong> [Concept]: InformationAudit (by Paul-Ryan76)</p>
<p id=x016 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> concept is okay to add as an organisation measure, but is generic and specifies any information - (to Paul as proposer) do you think we need a specific concept for Personal Data?</p>
<p id=x017 class="phone s02"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> the concept is okay as it is defined, but yet it would be good to also have a specific concept for personal data audits</p>
<p id=a01 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Add specialised concept for personal data audit under information audit</p>

<h3 id=t02>Human Subject</h3>
<p id=x020 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/205">Issue 205</a></strong> [Concept]: `HumanSubject` as the parent of `DataSubject` and `AISubject`  (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> we discussed previously that our existing <code>DataSubject</code> taxonomy is a good resource and would be helpful to have it being used also alongside other <em>Subject</em> concepts such as <code>AISubject</code>. For this, we proposed adding <code>HumanSubject</code> as the top concept under which the categories will be present, and then <code>DataSubject</code> etc. will be subclasses of this concept. Breaks backwards compatibility potentially in a minor but easily fixable way, but the benefits are greater in favour of doing this.</p>
<p id=x022 class="phone s03"><cite>iainHenderson:</cite> +1 to do this</p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> What about Organisations that are Customers - does this concept also cover that?</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> no, it doesn't - we specifically model only <em>natural persons</em> or <em>humans</em> and modelling organisational interrelationships is outside of our scope for now. In the future, if we want to do this, it will have to be a separate extension just for organisations and non-humans.</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> +1 for now as having these categories for humans would be helpful</p>
<p id=x026 class="phone s02"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> What will happen to <code>DataSubject</code> being the top concept?</p>
<p id=x027 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> It will be under <code>HumanSubject</code> so you can say a human category like <code>Tourist</code> is a data subject and it will be okay / correct - no compatibility issues with existing uses like this.</p>
<p id=x028 class="phone s02"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> +1 to go ahead with the approach</p>
<p id=x029 class="phone s05"><cite>delaramGolpayegani:</cite> how will this work with <code>AISubject</code>?</p>
<p id=x030 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> we will have <code>HumanSubject</code>, and then subclasses <code>DataSubject</code> in DPV, <code>TechnologySubject</code> in TECH and its subclass <code>AISubject</code> in AI extension</p>
<p id=x031 class="phone s05"><cite>delaramGolpayegani:</cite> What about other non-human subjects such as animals which might be what AI is used on?</p>
<p id=x032 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> outside of our scope for now - same as the issue with organisations as subjects. In the future we can think about this, but then we will try to explicitly denote they are <em>non-human subjects</em></p>
<p id=x033 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> how will this work with natural persons and legal persons?</p>
<p id=x034 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> <code>HumanSubject</code> will be a specific kind of <code>NaturalPerson</code>, and all natural persons are legal persons (we have <code>LegalEntity</code> as the concept for this)</p>
<p id=x035 class=summary> discussion concluded with agreement on adding this concept</p>
<p id=a02 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Add Human Subject</p>

<h3 id=t03>P7012</h3>
<p id=x038 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/203">Issue 203</a></strong> Create extension to support IEEE P7012 (by coolharsh55)</p>
<h4 id=t04>Tracking</h4>
<p id=x040 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/206">Issue 206</a></strong> [Concept]: `Tracking` (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x041 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> as discussed previously, P7012 implementation will require concepts that are not currently present in DPV; some such as <code>ServiceData</code> aren't clearly defined so we can put them in the extension, but others such as <code>Tracking</code> are already used and have a technical definition (e.g. see Do-Not-Track). Therefore we proposed to have this concept within DPV alongside the existing <code>Profiling</code> concept as a <code>Processing</code> operation that extends <code>Use</code> category of processing. This is because tracking uses data, and in that process it may also collect and generate additional data. But the minimal definition is that it uses some data to track the person across contexts.</p>
<p id=x042 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> DSA has profiling, so maybe we should wait for more info on that? </p>
<p id=x043 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> we already have <code>Profiling</code> in DPV, and in addition to this, we have <em>profiling</em> in the GDPR extension as defined in Art.4-4, and we can always update the definitions and concepts as the law and regulatory context evolves</p>
<p id=x044 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> DSA defines profiling as it is defined in GDPR Art.4-4 as well - so anything that supports expressing these would be good</p>
<p id=x045 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> so then we should add it - should we also add <em>First Party Tracking</em> and <em>Third Party Tracking</em> as these are also required for P7012 and are commonly used?</p>
<p id=x046 class="phone s03"><cite>iainHenderson:</cite> yes, these would be good to have</p>
<p id=x047 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> how would these be defined?</p>
<p id=x048 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> We will base these on existing definitions for the moment - though first and third party are not clearly defined concepts in legal terms for us to rely on them</p>
<p id=x049 class=summary> Discussion concluded with agreement on adding tracking and 1P, 3P variations with a note that it may evolve in the future</p>
<p id=a03 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Add Tracking concepts, with 1P and 3P variations</p>
<h4 id=t05>Concepts from DPV</h4>
<p id=x052 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/203">Issue 203</a></strong> Create extension to support IEEE P7012 (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x053 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Iain, what do you think is required or would be helpful for DPV to provide for P7012?</p>
<p id=x054 class="phone s03"><cite>iainHenderson:</cite> 1) <em>Data</em> - the DPV data types are not complete. Maybe a different way to organise it is needed e.g. customer data, service data, and so on that is more suitable for organisations to understand and use. Can come with proposal for orgs to understand and use.</p>
<p id=x055 class="phone s03"><cite>iainHenderson:</cite> 2) <em>Purpose</em> - The DPV purposes are not complete, the descriptions could be more detailed. Have some ideas on these as well.</p>
<p id=x056 class="phone s03"><cite>iainHenderson:</cite> 3) <em>Matrix of Purpose X Data</em> - providing a combination of purpose and involved data would make it much more simpler to use these concepts in practice e.g. service provision for home energey involves these specific data concepts, and in addition providing these concepts for what data can be involved will also assist in data minimisation</p>
<p id=x057 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> so you have a purpose, and then you are modelling the minimum data required to achieve that purpose?</p>
<p id=x058 class="phone s03"><cite>iainHenderson:</cite> yes, the extension is there to describe this in detail for specific sectors.</p>
<p id=x059 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> <em>Sector</em> is too broad, you should also have this for <em>Domain</em> e.g. Health and Consultancy (Sectors) both have HR (Domain) which is different for each of them</p>
<p id=x060 class="phone s03"><cite>iainHenderson:</cite> yes, trying to explain to the UK Gov. that this can be done to simplify agreements</p>
<p id=a04 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Iain to propose concepts for purposes, data, and combinations of these for specific sectors for P7012</p>

<h3 id=t06>Technology Provision</h3>
<p id=x063 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/207">Issue 207</a></strong> [Concept]: Change `TechnologyProvisionMethod` concepts e.g. `tech:System` to `tech:ProvidedAsSystem` (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x064 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> in previous discussion, we went through how the existing tech provision methods are confusing as they contain concepts like <code>System</code> while the AI extension has <code>AISystem</code> - which are two distinct interpretations. To avoid this, the proposal is to have the TECH extension use <code>System</code>, <code>Service</code>, etc. as types of technologies, and to create distinct concepts representing how they are provided, and to add a prefix or suffix to the concept to denote this.</p>
<p id=x065 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> for consent via privacy notice, where you provide the notice through a method, and then you collect it through a method - what is being described here?</p>
<p id=x066 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> in this case, the notice or dialogue is a technology, and we are describing how it is provided e.g. on a website it is a component as it is operating within the website (as a system), similarly other technologies might be subscriptions or entire systems (independent)</p>
<p id=x067 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Some options for the terms: 1) <code>ProvidedAsSystem</code> - we add prefixed <em>Provided as</em> to denote this is a type of provision; 2) <code>SystemProvision</code> - we add suffix <em>Provision</em> to denote it is being provisioned; 3) <code>SystemProvisionMethod</code> - we add suffix <em>Provision Method</em> to denote we are describing the method of provision. My preference is for n.1 as it is most clear and simple </p>
<p id=x068 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> +1 for n.1</p>
<p id=x069 class="phone s06"><cite>julianFlake:</cite> +1 for n.1</p>
<p id=a05 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Change TechnologyProvisionMethod concepts to have prefix ProvidedAsX</p>

<h3 id=t07>RISK</h3>
<p id=x072 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/181">Issue 181</a></strong> Refine RISK taxonomy into a single consistent hierarchy (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x073 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> since Delaram is here, good to go over this again - we have the RISK extension where there is a warning note for the taxonomy that it may change in the future i.e. it is unstable and don't rely on it. Since then we have updated it significantly. So should we remove the note? We leaned towards yes last week, but didn't have a clear agreement in the discussion.</p>
<p id=x074 class=summary> discussed and agreed to remove the warning</p>

<h3 id=t08>SECTOR</h3>
<p id=x076 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/204">Issue 204</a></strong> Create Sector Extension (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x077 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> as discussed last week, we have lots of concepts in the SECTOR extension - at the moment these are only purposes but we will also expect personal data and other things in the future - as Beatriz pointed out we may want to think about further modularising the concepts. So the question is whether we have one large extension and then the HTML has different sections for each sector or do we have modular smaller extensions within sector for each specific sector like what we do for the legal extensions? (see example on github in sector branch)</p>
<p id=x078 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> within each sector there will be domains that are the same, so maybe having domains is an alternative?</p>
<p id=x079 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> what do you mean by <em>sector</em> and <em>domain</em> here?</p>
<p id=x080 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> e.g. the HR in Health and Finance being two different things</p>
<p id=x081 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> we can do it this way - for general domains that are expected to be widely present, we keep them in DPV as we already have them in DPV e.g. the job hiring and other HR stuff; then the sector specific concepts or the sector-specific interpretation of domain concepts can go in the sector extensions e.g. employee in Health could be doctors, and employee evaluation for doctors means a very specific thing - so that can be extended in the sector extension</p>
<p id=x082 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> yes, modular is better - so let's go with that approach</p>
<p id=x083 class=summary> Discussion concluded with agreement on using modular approach for sector</p>

<p id=x087 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Do we stop the process of discussion and additions, and finalise what we have as of now as DPV 2.1?</p>

<h3 id=t10>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x099 class=summary> Discussion on meeting schedule yielded the following conclusion: We will circulate an internal poll for the next meeting times in the new year. There will be no meeting next week owing to Christmas break. Harsh will circulate the poll, and an email for the review tasks which people can do as they have time. Tentatively, we aim to meet around JAN-03 Friday.</p>
