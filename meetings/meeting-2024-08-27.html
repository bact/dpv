<h3 id=t02>Legal Basis</h3>
<p id=x015 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/111">Issue 111</a></strong> Model information about legal bases (by coolharsh55)</p>
<h4 id=t03>Consolidating Contract concepts</h4>
<p id=x017 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> following last week's discussion, we agreed that the different kinds of contracts and agreements are all legal bases and should be consolidated into a coherent and consistent vocabulary. To reflect this, I have moved the contract concepts from Legal Measures to create a single set of concepts. However, there is now duplicacy in the concepts e.g. <code>DataProcessorContract</code> and <code>ControllerProcessorAgreement</code> reflect the same concept. The name commonly used in industry is <code>...Agreement</code>, therefore we should keep these concepts and remove the other ones.</p>
<p id=x018 class="phone s03"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> agree on this, and also that Agreement is the preferred term in use for such concepts</p>
<p id=x019 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> instead of immediately removing the old concepts we can sunset them so as to give time to make changes if needed</p>
<p id=a01 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> consolidate contract taxonomy and sunset the not required concepts</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Contract Taxonomy</h3>
<p id=x022 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> should we keep the the B2C etc. concepts? Are they useful? I also added in G2B and other relevant government concepts - except C2G which seems to not be well adopted and defined as compared to the others.</p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> yes, these would be useful to have and we should add them</p>
<p id=x024 class=summary> agreed to add these</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> Other contract concepts include contract clause types, contract statuses, contract controls, and contract/clause fulfilment states. </p>
<p id=x026 class=summary> agreed to add these</p>
<p id=a02 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> add contract clause types, contract statuses, contract controls, and contract/clause fulfilment states</p>
<h4 id=t05>Standard Form Contract</h4>
<p id=x029 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> From the IEEE P7012 perspective of modelling contracts, we have Negotiated contract and non-negotiated contract which is called <u>Standard Form Contract</u>. For non-negotiated contract, which entity drafted the terms is relevant - typically it is the controller or service provider, but with P7012 it can also be the individual or consumer. To reflect these, two new concepts are proposed as subclasses of Standard Form Contract - <code>ProviderStandardFormContract</code> to indicate the provider drafted it and <code>ConsumerStandardFormContract</code> to indicate the consumer drafted it.</p>
<p id=x030 class="phone s05"><cite>iainHenderson:</cite> would prefer to use individual instead of consumer to indicate the onus or burden is not on the person to do everything and to highlight that the work is done in an individual capacity</p>
<p id=x031 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> agreed, though in this case it is <u>consumer</u> because the entity may or may not be a person e.g. an organisation receiving the service</p>
<p id=x032 class=summary> agreed to add these</p>
<h4 id=t06>Statuses</h4>
<p id=x034 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> for the other legal bases other than consent and contract, no further concepts are needed to model them as the required concepts are present in DPV already e.g. for Legal Obligation there is <code>dpv:hasApplicableLaw</code>. Should we model statuses to keep track of the fulfilment of these other legal bases?</p>
<p id=x035 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> yes, these would be essential to model the legal bases</p>
<p id=x036 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> okay, so we have the statuses for Legitimate Interest. For others, they can be as follows: Legal Obligation - fulfilled, not fulfilled, being fulfilled. Official Authority - exercised, not exercised, being exercised. Vital Interest - (vital interest) identified, protected, not protected, being protected, objected. Public Interest - (benefit) identified, being provided, provided, not provided, objected.</p>
<p id=a03 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> create statuses for other legal bases</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t07>Fee</h3>
<p id=x039 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/185">Issue 185</a></strong> [Concept]: Add Fee concept to DPV, remove it from RISK (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x040 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> as discussed in the last meeting, <code>Fee</code> is not a kind of risk or impact, and we discussed moving it to DPV. Instead of directly moving the concept <code>Fee</code>, it would be better to have the concept as a context - <code>FeeRequirement</code> with two concepts representing whether fee applies <code>FeeRequired</code> and doesn't appy <code>FeeNotRequired</code>. To indicate the value of the fee, <code>rdf:value</code> is used or another way of representing this.</p>
<p id=x041 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> the advantage of creating a separate concept instead of directly specifying the value is that the concept enables attaching other information to it e.g. specific currencies or duration within which fee must be paid or to whom and when</p>
<p id=x042 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> we should indicate who should pay it? when? etc.? </p>
<p id=x043 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> this might be property for who pays the fee e.g. <code>dpv:hasFeePayer</code> and we can reuse <code>dpv:hasRecipient</code> here to indicate who receives the fee. Duration, Frequency, etc. can be used to indicate more information about the fee.</p>
<p id=x044 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> we should also have statuses to keep track of whether fee is paid e.g. fee paid, fee unpaid</p>
<p id=x045 class=summary> agree to add these</p>
<p id=a04 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> create Fee concepts</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t08>Rights Impact</h3>
<p id=x048 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/184">Issue 184</a></strong> Add Rights Impact concepts for each Right (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x049 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> to model impacts on rights, we have the concept <code>RightsImpact</code>. To model specific categories of impacts, we will need different kinds of impacts - should we create specific kinds of impacts? For each specific right?</p>
<p id=x050 class=summary> georg and tytti agree that this would be helpful</p>
<p id=a05 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Create rights impact categories and create rights impact concepts for each right</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t09>Mapping between GDPR and DPV</h3>
<p id=x053 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/186">Issue 186</a></strong> Create Mapping between GDPR and DPV (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x054 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> Prinon proposed that we do a mapping between GDPR and DPV concepts i.e. for which GDPR clause which concept in DPV is relevant. Through this exercise, we can see where we lack concepts, and also for GDPR practioners this will give useful information on how to use DPV. The idea is to put this as a table in the EU-GDPR extension. </p>
<p id=x055 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> this would be a good idea, we should also show  which concepts are required in which process e.g. what is needed for a ROPA, what is needed for a DPIA</p>
<p id=x056 class="phone s03"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> for ROPA - there is the DPCat work that does this</p>
<p id=x057 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> good start with ROPA by paul and harsh - we can start with that</p>
<p id=x058 class=summary> agree to do this</p>
<p id=x059 class="phone s01"><cite>prinonDas:</cite> what would be the timeline for this? Would prefer to get this done by 9th October.</p>
<p id=x060 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> okay, that's doable</p>
<p id=x061 class="phone s04"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> interested in participating in this</p>
<p id=a06 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Create a mapping from GDPR to DPV</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t10>DPIA</h3>
<p id=x064 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/183">Issue 183</a></strong> Represent activities where DPIA is required in EU-GDPR (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x065 class="phone s06"><cite>tyttiRintamaki:</cite> proposing 76 concepts to be added to EU-GDPR extension for conducting DPIA based on analysis of DPIA guidelines; will share the list by email for feedback. Each concept is derived from a DPIA requirement i.e. what processing activities require a DPIA based on DPIA guideline. On github, there will be an example for how to represent the activity in RDF using DPV.</p>
<p id=x066 class="phone s02"><cite>harshPandit:</cite> We created a new concept called <code>eu-gdpr:DPIARequiredProcess</code> which will be a subclass of <code>dpv:Process</code> and represents the cases where a DPIA is required based on GDPR, EDPB, or a DPA guideline. The idea is that the process concepts is used to match processes, e.g. purpose and personal data - and if there is a match, then it means a DPIA is required.</p>

<section>
<h3 id=t11>AI Bias</h3>
<p id=x068 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/182">Issue 182</a></strong> Adding AI bias concepts (by DelaramGlp)</p>
<p id=x069 class="phone s07"><cite>danielDoherty:</cite> added the RDF for the AI Bias concept - though there is an error in the ISO standard being noted - it should be 2021 for the final published document and not 2020 as noted in the RDF. The version I used was the CD draft. Will update the definitions to the final published version - the concepts are the same as verified through the table of concepts.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t12>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x071 class=summary> next meeting will be in 1 week on TUESDAY 03 September at 13:30 WEST / 14:40 CEST. Agenda will be continuation of today's topics with any updates on github/mailing list and AOB. Harsh will be away at the Annual Privacy Forum presenting the ISO 27560 DPV paper.</p>
