<h3 id=t01>Discrimination concepts</h3>
<p id=x013 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/190">Issue 190</a></strong> [Concept]: Discrimination Concepts in RISK (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x014 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> found this nice resource that lists all the relevant legislations for discrimination <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0565">https://<wbr>eur-lex.europa.eu/<wbr>legal-content/<wbr>EN/<wbr>TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0565</a> - we can use this to model specific discrimination concepts and also create specific/separate workplace discrimination concepts such as <em>workplace discrimination based on sex</em> to indicate the regulated area</p>
<p id=x015 class=summary> group agreed to go ahead with this approach</p>
</section>

<h3 id=t02>Rights Impact concepts</h3>
<p id=x017 class=bot><cite>&lt;ghurlbot&gt;</cite> <strong><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/184">Issue 184</a></strong> Add Rights Impact concepts for each Right (by coolharsh55)</p>
<p id=x018 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Added impact concepts for each GDPR right - see <a href="https://dev.dpvcg.org/2.1-dev/legal/eu/gdpr/#vocab-rights-impacts">https://<wbr>dev.dpvcg.org/<wbr>2.1-dev/<wbr>legal/<wbr>eu/<wbr>gdpr/#vocab-rights-impacts</a> ; in addition to this, also tried to create more specific concepts for Art.13 information provided when data is collected from data subject - by using the RISK impact concepts e.g. denied, eroded, limited with definitions that contextualise it for Art.13 e.g. <code>A13Limited</code> is <em>not providing all required information</em>.</p>
<p id=x019 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Also added impact concepts for each EU Fundamental Right - see <a href="https://dev.dpvcg.org/2.1-dev/legal/eu/rights/#vocab-impacts">https://<wbr>dev.dpvcg.org/<wbr>2.1-dev/<wbr>legal/<wbr>eu/<wbr>rights/#vocab-impacts</a> where in addition to each right having a corresponding impact concept, Art.8 right to data protection - also created impact category concepts e.g. denied, eroded, limited, and in addition also created specific concepts that represents parts of the right not being fulfilled e.g. right of access not provided, or data being processed without a valid legal basis.</p>
<p id=x020 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> This represents three approaches - Approach 1 is where we simply model one impact concept corresponding to each right; Approach 2 is where we expand on this one concept with more specific impact categories e.g. denied, limited, and so on; Approach 3 is where we also model specific aspects of the right that are not fulfilled e.g. invalid legal basis or right of access for Art.8 mentioned earlier. Each approach builds on top of the previous one and gives more concepts, but also makes it more complex.</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> how would these be used? Who is using these? Thinking of how the data subject would use these for rights exercise. What sort of a tool would use these concepts? The information is difficult to understand on its own as it directly relates to the legal specifics. How to represent what caused these impacts?</p>
<p id=x022 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> This is a complicated situation as we aren't modelling one particular use-case but supporting many use-cases e.g. rights exercise, impact assessments, risk assessments, internal audits, external compliance investigations, and so on. Therefore, each rights impact concept can tick multiple boxes based on the situation e.g. if some information is not provided, modelling it directly as an impact might not be appropriate as it could still be part of the ongoing correspondence between data subject and controller - and if it is the conclusion then the choice has to be made whether it counts as right denial or limitation or obstruction - so multiple boxes can be ticked.</p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s03"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> see the value in doing this, but it won't be easy as there is a lot of information and it has to support the practical use-cases</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> lets think of how an auditor or an authority will see or use this; let's take an example where the information provided is difficult to understand - this is not the same as not providing the information or only providing limited information</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s03"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> there will be records of each activity undertaken for the right, which the auditor or authority will ask for, and then assess whether it meets the requirements of the regulation</p>
<p id=x026 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> yes, agree with that - the order in my perspective is as follows: first the applicable rights are identified e.g. we have the legal basis x rights mapping table to help with this; then for each right there is a corresponding requirement that must be identified to be fulfilled e.g. provide information or data; then for each requirement it is to be assessed whether it has been completed or not; and then for each unfulfilled requirement the impact has to be identified from our impact category; then the assessment has to be made whether this counts as a violation of the right and therefore there is some decision or penalty</p>
<p id=x027 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> based on this, we have concepts for rights, we have concepts for impacts - so both ends are covered, but the middle parts where the specific requirements to fulfil a right are missing, and the various ways in which there can be an unfulfillment of that right is also missing. So from Georg's example, we can see that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between rights requirement fulfillment steps and potential causes of unfulfillment - which means we should have a separate list of concepts</p>
<p id=x028 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> and then for the unfulfilled step there is a justification which can be valid or invalid</p>
<p id=x029 class="phone s03"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> two more use-cases - first where an ID is not supplied for the right and therefore the right request is denied and the data subject went to the authority who then approached and asked for the record; and second where the data rectification could not be fulfilled due to potential issues - in both cases there was a record of the interaction and then after the investigation there were additional steps taken to complete the rights process where needed</p>
<p id=x030 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> good examples, this means from the data subject's perspective it is better to state directly that some step has not been fulfilled rather than jumping directly to violation or denial of a right, similarly from the controller's perspective it is better to list what step could not be fulfilled with the justification and then state whether the right was unfulfilled as the conclusion, and from the authority's perspective they assess this record of interaction and decide whether this counts as a right obstruction or violation or something else or nothing</p>
<p id=x031 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> agreed, then we have missing concepts for stating exactly what has been unfulfilled</p>
<p id=x032 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> okay, then we have an action here to create these missing concepts to represent what must be fulfilled for the right, and then what are the potential unfulfillment cases which can lead to an impact on rights. At the moment, I have included both as impacts e.g. in Art.8 EU-RIGHTS. To separate these, what should we call these?</p>
<p id=x033 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Should these non-impact concepts (e.g. information not provided for A.13) be moved to a <em>Consenquences for Rights</em> separate list, and then we have impacts on rights as including only the impact categories (e.g. violated)? We can name these <code>RightFulfilmentRisk</code> and <code>RightImpact</code>?</p>
<p id=x034 class="phone s04"><cite>julianFlake:</cite> possibly yes this would work, but there must be a way to simplify this as it is getting complex and even if the expressiveness is needed it can be confusing and difficult to use</p>
<p id=x035 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> agreed - though not sure how to simplify this as we are not only modelling rights impact assessments but also risk assessments in general; open to suggestions</p>
<p id=x036 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> CJEU case controllers must document which processors and subprocessors it uses; the GDPR risk based approach does not include not documenting information - so we should aim to provide as much documentation as is practically required</p>
<p id=x037 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> okay, so I will implement this discussion and circulate an email explaining the arrangement so that we have time to look at this before the next meeting</p>
