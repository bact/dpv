<h3 id=t01>Changes needed for v2.1</h3>
<p id=x015 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> In the course of completing the documentation for v2.1, e.g. while writing examples, several concepts were found missing which are needed for implementations and would be good to provide with this release.</p>
<h4 id=t02>Consent Controls</h4>
<p id=x017 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> In consent controls, we have controls for providing and withdrawing consent, but not for rejecting consent. Therefore, added <code>dpv:RefuseConsent</code> as a control. Additionally, added <code>dpv:ManageConsent</code> as a control that is commonly used for multiple actions like provide, withdraw, and reaffirm. These concepts were found to be needed when writing the example for the notice layers and icons - <a href="https://dev.dpvcg.org/2.1-dev/dpv/modules/TOM#example-using-notice-layer-and-icon-in-a-consent-notice">https://<wbr>dev.dpvcg.org/<wbr>2.1-dev/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>modules/<wbr>TOM#example-using-notice-layer-and-icon-in-a-consent-notice</a></p>
<p id=x018 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> Agree these should be modelled, though what is the wording on the control? How can implementations have correct phrasing like on buttons?</p>
<p id=x019 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> It is &quot;refuse consent&quot; and the accepting one is &quot;provide consent&quot; - these are modelled from the perspective of the data subject. In implementations, these can be used as is, or can be customised to suit the use-case.</p>
<p id=x020 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> The 27560 record lacks recording this information. How to store this information in a record?</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> 27560 only deals with the consent decision - so it only records the information associated with the processing that the consent is about, not the specifics of what was presented and what was shown. For that, we will need a record of 29184 - that's what I'm slowly working on. It won't be ready for v2.1, but the goal is to write data in DPV and then use that to generate a UI/UX for consent based on 29184, or vice-versa to record a notice using DPV based on 29184.</p>
<h4 id=t03>AI properties</h4>
<p id=x023 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> I didn't find <code>ai:hasTechnique</code> and <code>ai:hasCapability</code> in the AI extension, and don't recall whether we discussed these and they didn't get added (mea culpa) or there are instead other properties for these?</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s03"><cite>delaramGolpayegani:</cite> I think for capability, the TECH extension had a property <code>tech:hasCapability</code> and that's why we didn't have it in AI.</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> yes, I see the property - though I think it would be good to also have it in AI since we extend the concept?</p>
<p id=x026 class="phone s03"><cite>delaramGolpayegani:</cite> yes, both properties should be added.</p>
<p id=a01 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Add <code>ai:hasTechnique</code> and <code>ai:hasCapability</code> to AI</p>
<p id=x028 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Should we reuse examples from your (Delaram's) thesis and work in the AI and AIAct extension? How can they be adapted?</p>
<p id=x029 class="phone s03"><cite>delaramGolpayegani:</cite> yes, I think so - the Proctoring and Uber use-cases can be reused. The Proctoring example should be generic and can be put in AI, and the Uber use-case is based on existing decisions - so it can be put in AIAct or elsewhere based on concepts.</p>
<p id=a02 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Add examples to AI and AIAct extensions based on Delaram's existing examples</p>
<h4 id=t04>Legal Basis</h4>
<p id=x032 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> For contracts, we have statuses in 2.1, but we need two concepts to represent 1) contracts being accepted or signed by all parties, and 2) contract being signed by some but not all parties.</p>
<p id=x033 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> yes, this should be modelled - generally the contract is said to be accepted when someone signs it.</p>
<p id=x034 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Yes, from that entity's perspective. But how to represent <u>all parties</u> have signed it, and only <u>some parties</u> have signed and others are yet to sign? How about <code>PartiallyAccepted</code> and <code>Accepted</code>?</p>
<p id=x035 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> Not sure about the wording.</p>
<p id=x036 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Let's keep this as a placeholder - if we find a better phrasing we can replace it.</p>
<p id=a03 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Create concepts to represent contract accepted by 1 party, N parties, and ALL parties</p>
<p id=a04 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> FIX DPV Legal Basis module page - add status table for each basis section</p>
<h4 id=t05>GDPR Mappings</h4>
<p id=x040 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Added a simple table showing which concept in GDPR has which corresponding concept in DPV - <a href="https://dev.dpvcg.org/2.1-dev/legal/eu/gdpr/#mapping">https://<wbr>dev.dpvcg.org/<wbr>2.1-dev/<wbr>legal/<wbr>eu/<wbr>gdpr/#mapping</a> </p>
<p id=a05 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Add references to the GDPR concept e.g. Art.4-1</p>
<p id=x042 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> P7012</p>
<p id=x043 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Sharing updates - discussed with Iain and Beatriz in the last month. The idea is to provide these concepts in DPV as a draft extension. While P7012 models 'contracts', we use 'privacy term' to denote a term which can be combined or be used to create a contract on its own. These terms are then expressed using the DPV vocabulary. To express specifics - like something is permitted or is prohibited - we have 'privacy modifiers' e.g. tracking allowed or not allowed. This is to support explicit interpretations in jurisdictions where absence of permission or prohibition has differing interpretations.</p>

<section>
<h3 id=t06>Future Concepts</h3>
<p id=x045 class="phone s04"><cite>paulRyan:</cite> Would be good to have DPV used for data sharing agreements, controller-processing agreements, and such - now that we have contracts being modelled.</p>
<p id=x046 class="phone s02"><cite>georgKrog:</cite> Agree - I went through hundreds of such agreements, and there are a lot of common clauses which we should represent. DPV would be a good resource of help here. These are related to Article 28.</p>
<p id=x047 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Generally, representing the contracts and information in them should be in scope of DPV as we model GDPR and these are about instructions from controller to processor etc. - so we can certainly look at that. I've been thinking about something like a 'template' for contracts, DPIA, etc. which we can provide using DPV, which is then used in an use-case and populated with the use-case specific information.</p>

<section>
<h3 id=t07>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x049 class=summary> Next meeting is scheduled for THU JAN-09 13:30 WET / 14:30 CET. Harsh will circulate agenda/invite. For deciding on a regular meeting slot for the next year, Harsh will circulate a poll on Monday, and then we will take a decision based on that.</p>
